image_processor is a ROS 2 package that:

1. Loads/exported 8x8 pixel images from your GUI (like text_pixelated_8x8.png)

2. Labels each pixel like a chessboard (e.g. A1, A2, B3…)

3. Extracts each pixel’s color

4. publishes that pixel data as messages to a ROS 2 topic

The package is placed in the following directory: 
~/ros2_ws/src/image_processor/

The folder structure is as follows:
